[Atomicapp](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp) gets [0.3.0](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases/tag/0.3.0) release!

A major highlight of this release is the new provider: [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/). Apart from this, numerous other features and bug fixes and changes went into this release:

 * A complete refactor of our OpenShift provider (API comm rather than oc command)
 * Support for `oc new-app` deployment
 * Refactor on CLI commands and options
 * Optios such as --answers-conf can now be used anywhere on the
 command line
