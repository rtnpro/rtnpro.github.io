We resumed our monthly meetups in Bangalore on the March 7, 2015. We've now decided to hold Fedora meetup in Bangalore on the 1st Saturday of every month. Here's link to our event on Fedora Calendar: https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/meeting/2036/.

We met at [Starbucks Coffee, Indiranagar](http://goo.gl/2d1WtN). at 6 PM. It was good place to chat and had free wifi internet too. We were 4 people. We discussed on:

- upcoming Fedora 22 release
- contributing to testing Fedora 22 images
- contributing to Fedora Infra

We were also having some discussions on #fedora-apps on Freenode during the meetup regarding various tasks we're handling and brainstorming on new ideas. The folks in the meetup also found [Kushal Das's worknotes](http://worknotes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) very handy to get started with testing of Fedora cloud images. The discussions were not just limited to Fedora. We also shared the cool things we have been working on at our workplaces, new technologies: reactjs, meteorjs, polymer, golang, etc.

We wrapped up at around 8 PM. We're looking forward to catch up once again with Fedora enthusiasts in Bangalore on April 4, 2015 at [Starbucks Coffee, Indiranagar](http://goo.gl/2d1WtN).
