We again met at [Starbucks Coffee, Indiranagar](http://goo.gl/2d1WtN) on June 6, 2015 at 5:30 PM for our monthly Fedora meetup in Bangalore.

Attendees:

- [Ratnadeep Debnath](https://github.com/rtnpro)
- [Lalatendu Mohanty](https://github.com/LalatenduMohanty)
- [Nitish Bharadwaj](https://github.com/nitishb)

Topics discussed:

- Openstack setup and overview
- Vagrant on Fedora, it's quirks and how we can make it more awesome
- [Statscache](https://github.com/fedora-infra/statscache) demo
- How to start contributing to Fedora infra

This meetup was one of the most fruitful Fedora meetups in Bangalore. We had folks from different communities (Project Atomic, Openstack) to add more value to the meetup. I hope that we can maintain the same or better streak of awesomeness. Also, we are considering to move to a quieter place for the next meetup. Stay tuned for updates on [Fedora India mailing list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/india) .

See you, next month!.
