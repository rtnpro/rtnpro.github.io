It’s more than a year now that I have been working at Transifex. It’s a great experience to be a part of the Transifex team. Well, it’s been a roller coaster ride for me at Transifex. I had to go through steep learning curves, work with new stuffs, deliver great features, meet strict deadlines. It was fun, because of being part of an awesome team. I am very much thankful to Apostolis, Konstantinos, John and Diego for guiding me and helping me.

During the course of this journey, I have made many friends. It’s always great to speak with the OpenTranslators folk. They all rock. I am also very much thankful to Youversion, Eventbrite, Pinterest, Dropbox folks for their queries and feedback. It makes me happy to help resolve issues with Transifex and add new features for our users. It gives me a sense of satisfaction that I am able to play my part for the greater good.

Mozilla has always fascinated me since a long time. I love Mozilla, it’s logos, it’s products and it’s goals. At Transifex, I worked on developing new API features to support Pontoon use Transifex as a backend. Following this, I also got involved with Pontoon’s development and have made a few commits. Finally, I contributed in some way to a Mozilla project.

A long road lies ahead. I hope it to be full of new challenges and excitement.
