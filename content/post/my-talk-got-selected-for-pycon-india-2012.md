My proposed talk titled [Develop for an international audience](http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/22-develop-for-an-international-audience) got selected for Pycon India, 2012. Itâ€™s time to start working on the slides. I am thinking to use [rst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) to write my slides. Also, I have booked by flight tickets for Pycon ![:)](http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

Thanks everyone who voted for my talk.
