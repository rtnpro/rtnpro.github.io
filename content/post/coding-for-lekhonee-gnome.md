Lately, I have been studying the code of lekhonee-gnome. It is written in vala. I wrote a patch for it to allow saving of drafts locally after every 30 seconds. I submitted it to the upstream, kushal for approval.

<div></div><div>Now, I am testing another patch of mine for lekhonee-gnome. Previously, whenever one used to press “Publish” button, the written post is cleared from the editor. Once, due to network problems, the post was not published, and with it my post was also cleared from the editor. I don’t think that’s a desireable feature. Even, wordpress editor does not clear the post after publishing it.</div>
