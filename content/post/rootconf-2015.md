Last month, May 15-16, there was [Rootconf](https://rootconf.in) in Bangalore. Rootconf is a premier conference for devops and system administrators. The highlights of this Rootconf were **SaltStack**, **RancherOS**, **Project Atomic**, **PostgreSQL**, etc. We also had Fedora presence in the conference. 3 Fedora ambassadors: Aditya Patawari, Praveen Kumar and myself were present at the event. We distributed Fedora 21 workstation DVDs at the registration desk and announced about [FUDCON Pune, 2015](http://fudcon.in/) as well.

### Day 1
Day 1 started with Abhishek Kona speaking on why and how they rewrote [parse.com](https://parse.com/) for scale. This was followed by **Introduction to SaltStack** by Mike Place. Then, after tea break, Anand Chitipothu spoke on **10 reasons why you should prefer PostgreSQL to MySQL**. 
This was followed by Akbar speaking on how LinkedIn is leveraging kafka for log aggregation and monitoring. After lunch, I attended Aditya Patawari's talk on running containers in a sane environment Project Atomic: OSTree, Cockpit, Kubernetes.

The day started with Bernd Erk [Icinga](https://www.icinga.org/) over Nagios. This was followed by Shanker speaking on running microservices on Docker at scale using [RancherOS](http://rancher.com/).
