Its 3:00 PM , 1 December 2003. Just now I got my medical report and I am very happy to see that I recovered from Hepatitis. The Bilirubin level is 0.8 now. What a relief! But not for long. Do you know why? Semester exam starts from 4th December. Pressure from all the ends. Last week was a long frustrating week. We had practical exams. Bruised like anything in the electronics and electrical viva voce, but PPL practical exam was great.

What could be more frustrating? Have been suffering since the beginning of November, could not use 500 MB of my free net usage, could not study, no FOSS activitiesâ€¦and now the EXAM. Its like I am on FIRE right now!!! Enough of blogging for now. Later.
