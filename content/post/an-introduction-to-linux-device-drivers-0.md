Iâ€™ll be honest, I am neither a kernel hacker nor a device driver writer, but I want to be one. I am studying the Linux Device Drivers 3, the LDD 3. It is an effort from my end to document what I have understood from reading the LDD 3. There might be some errors or misinterpretation on my part and I will be glad if anyone corrects me. I will be trying to keep the things as correct as possible.
