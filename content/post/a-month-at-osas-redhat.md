This had been lying in the draft for quite some time now, waiting to be published. Better late, than never.

Well, I joined the **container tools** team in **OSAS**, **Redhat** on August 24, 2015. Nevertheless, I had already been contributing to the upstream projects around projectatomic prior to joining Redhat :). It was not a totally new environment at Redhat, I knew many people from the Fedora community at Redhat and in our team. It's like working amongst friends.

I am working from home, as a remotee, in my boxers (and not pyjamas). Working from home gives me the independence to work when I please and be more productive. It also saves a lot of time in commuting to office, especially, in a city like Bangalore. Whatever time I save, can be translated into more contributions to Open Source. So, my day job, finally, became contributing to upstream Open Source projects. I do not find the difference between work and contribution now, everything is fun.

I spent the initial few weeks at Redhat exploring the Atomic ecosystem, getting confused with so many **Atomic\*** nomenclature, playing and fighting with kubernetes and trying to map my **docker\*** knowledge with kubernetes. Oh! It was loads of reading. I started playing with the Nulecule specification and nuleculizing applications. I kept on exploring and documenting my findings and writing blog posts on them. I started working on bug fixes in atomicapp, but I was not satisfied, I was looking for more. At long last, I stumbled upon the much needed refactor of [**atomicapp**](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp) codebase and started working on [**refactoring**](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/pull/278), and  things became **exciting**. The goal of the refactor was to make the codebase more modular, more readable, easy to munch, and get started with.

Apart from my work at work at Redhat, I have also been contributing to the Fedora community, especially, [autocloud](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/autocloud) and writing [test cases](https://github.com/kushaldas/tunirtests) for testing Fedora Atomic images.

Those were mostly my stint during my first month at Redhat. So far, so good and it looks like an exciting road up ahead.
