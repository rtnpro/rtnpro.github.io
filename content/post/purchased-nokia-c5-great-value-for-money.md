Last week was bad. My Nokia 5310â€™s keypad stopped working, then my BSNL 3G data card broke. I could hardly be online the last week. Yesterday, I purchased Nokia C5 and it seems to be a good investment. I had to pay Rs 7,620 only for it. Compared to the price, the features are great. You can see the features of this phone from [http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_c5-3122.php](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_c5-3122.php).

It has got a 600 MHz ARM 11 processor, 128 MB RAM, USB charging. In that respects, it seems better than N79. It has got 3G and supports speed upto 10.2 Mbps. The 3.2 MP camera is good enough with a decent flash. Sound is also good. It runs S60 3rd Edition OS.

I my opinion, its a good (or best) phone to go for within Rs 8,000.
