Happy Durga Puja to all.

It has been a long run since I left for Durgapur after the Software Freedom Day,2009 at Kolkata. I reached Howrah station at around 8:15 PM on 15th September 2009. Though I got an  e-ticket for Durgapur in the Danapur Express which was about to leave from Howrah at 9:35 PM, I still didn’t have a hard copy. I thought I could get a print out at the station from the .html file of the e-ticket I was having in my mobile phone. As ill luck would have it, the one cyber cafe that was there in Howrah station was being demolished (might be for repairs … drastic). I had plenty of time though, so I went outside the station to try my luck. With some help from the folks out there, I started my venture to find a place to print my ticket. Couldn’t find any in the proximity. Finally I found one, but the shop’s printer ran out of ink. What the hell! It was 9:15 PM and so I returned and boarded the train. My mobile phone was almost out of charge, and so I transferred the only document of my ticket to my laptop. When the TTE came, I showed him the html file and after some arguments, I was able to convince him. It could have been worse. I didn’t have my Identity Card with me.

I reached Durgapur at 11:30 PM. Then at around 3:00 AM in the morning boarded the JHAJHA-Guwahati Express for AlipurDuar Junction, my father’s home town. Quite uneventful days in AlipurDuar and Coachbehar ( my mother’s home town) except for family reunion. Finally came back to Guwahati on 20th September, 2009.

First thing I did was install linux (omega) in my father’s computer and explained the advantages of it to my father. Next day, my father told his colleagues that in linux, you don’t need to worry about viruses ( in general). I started getting calls from them to install Linux in their systems too. I did two installs of Omega coupled with the other packages installed from the Fedora 11 repository I am carrying in my portable HDD.

Internet connection had been quite unstable here. The BSNL link most of the times is down and since yesterday, the phone line is dead. This week, mbuf made some new plans for fedx and told me to go through Makefile HowTo. He assigned me some tasks. Today I have completed the first one of them … that was to write a makefile rule to check is vsftpd is installed in a system. If not, to install it in the system. Made a commit today in my fedx’s clone at gitorious. Thanks to smartnet, it came as life saver, when BSNL is down.

This week, did lots of fun with my brother. Went for long distance biking, to restaurants, to computer shops to enquire about notebooks for him. Today it was Ashtami, we fasted till noon and offered pushpanjali to Goddess Durga. Then in the evening, me and my BRO went to see the Durga Pujas in Maligaon in the evening.

Tomorrow I plan to go to Accoland with my brother. Looking forward to a great day ![:D](http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)
