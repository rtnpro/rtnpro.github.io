In this post, I will be sharing my experiences in my attempts to write Open Source software and things you want to avoid in doing so. This post is just my point of view and you are welcome to disagree.

- Don't over engineer
- Looking for contributors before getting users
- Don't try to release the perfect product

Always try to get a minimal viable product usable by people. The first attempt should be to get users. Trying to build a community of contributors for your project, until and unless they are driven by a common goal, can lead to a disaster.
