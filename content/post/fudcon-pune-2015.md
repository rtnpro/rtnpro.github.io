After 4 years, after 2011, FUDCon came back to Pune, again in 2015. It took place from 26th to 28th June, 2015 at MIT, Pune. Fedora Users and Developers Conference (FUDCon) is the annual conference for people interested in Fedora in any way. This year's FUDCon had a great line up of talks and multiple parallel tracks: Container, Openstack, Storage. I took part in FUDCon this year as a speaker and a volunteer. It was an amazing experience to work late nights carrying swags, processing event videos, and chatting with fellow Fedora folks.

**Day1** began with a keynote from Dennis Gilmore on "Delivering Fedora for everything and everyone". This was followed by a panel discussion on topics related to FOSS in Education. Following this, I attended the talk on DNF: the package manager in Fedora 22, by Parag Nemade. Then there was Vaidik Kapoor speaking on Vagrant where he introduced people to what is Vagrant and it's uses. He also shared his experience on streamlining the development workflow in Wingify with Vagrant. Post lunch, there was a lightning talks session. I gave a lightning talk to showcase Waartaa, it's current status and roadmap. After that I spent the remaining time hacking on [ircb](https://github.com/waartaa/ircb), a scalable IRC bouncer written using Python 3 asyncio for [Waartaa](https://github.com/waartaa/waartaa). The day ended with an awesome keynote from Harish Pillay on "What's going on in a FOSS project".

**Day2** started with the keynote from Jiri Eishchmann on "Present and Future of Fedora Workstation", where he shared the current status of Fedora Workstation, and especially about Gnome, which powers Fedora Workstation and it's future roadmap. Following this, I attended the talk on "Kernel and Userspace Tracing with LTTng and Friends". Suchakra did a great job in delivering the content for a complex subject in an easy to understand format. Then, I was there listening to Rejy on "Be secure with SELinux". Then I listened to Nigel Babu speaking on how to contribute code to Mozilla. In the talk, Nigel walked us through the plethora of awesome Mozilla projects and how to start contributing to them. After that, it was Sayan Chowdhury's talk on Fedmsg. Post lunch, I attended Izhar's talk on how to sell Open Source, where he shared his own experiences and learnings from running a startup based around Open Source softwares. It was followed by a kickass talk on "Running Project Atomic and Docker on Fedora" by Aditya Patawari and Lalatendu Mohanty, and the talk was very well received by the audience. I also got the chance to operate the video recorder during this talk to ensure that the speaker always remains in focus. Aditya gave me a hard time by keeping on moving across the stage, though :\ It was followed by Prasad (pjp) speaking on DNSSEC. This was followed by a very touching ending keynote by Tenzin Chokden on "Achieving community goals with Fedora". The conference day2 ended, and began the FUDPub. It was fun to hang out and have fun with fellow Fedora community members and volunteers :)

**Day3** was just workshops, workshops and BOFs. There were workshops on Inkscape, Docker, Fedora Atomic, version control, kubernetes, Docker orchestration using Kubernetes on Openshift, Flask, etc. I and Sayan conducted the workshop on Flask and walked the attendees through the Flask projects in Fedora Infrastructure that they can start contributing to. Post our workshop, I resumed working hacking on **ircb** again. Then, there was Fedora APAC BOF, in the afternoon, where we discussed on various topics to boost the momentum of Fedora community in the APAC region. The day and FUDCON concluded with Rupali thanking all the folks who made this event a success.

FUDCon has always been a great event where Fedora users and contributors meet together to learn from each other, brainstorm and work on ideas to make Fedora and Fedora community more awesome. This year's FUDCon was no different. Events like this help us to learn, grow, and charge our batteries to contribute more to Open Source and the community.
