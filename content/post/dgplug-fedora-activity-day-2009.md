A Fedora Activity Day is going to be conducted by the Linux Users’ Group of Durgapur, DGPLUG in Dr. B. C. Roy Engneering College, Durgapur on 14 May, 2009.

The agenda of this FAD is to increase FOSS awareness among the students of BCREC and to introduce them to the wide spectrum of things that they can do in Linux in their day to day life.

Fedora is not just an operating system, it is a community comprised of people coming from different walks of life, yet all believing in the foundations of Fedora

> Freedom Friends Features First

There is a place for anyone in Fedora, for anyone who wants to contribute, irrespective of their technical skill level. We will be trying to convey this message with the help of a talk on ***Fedora Project***. Then, there will be a session on ***“Fedora in your day to day life”***.

This will be followed by workshops on :

- Introduction to Vim text editor
