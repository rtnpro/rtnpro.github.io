A lot has happened since I last blogged. I’m now not going to recollect my memories :P. Any ways, if I were to summarise, I was busy with college seminars, project reports, semester exams, etc. What a drag!

After the exams ended, I felt like a free bird ready to fly high. I started studying Django. I am also revising python.

Yesterday, I packaged python-keyring-0.5.1 for F14. It fixes some bugs in keyring v 0.5. But, I am not able to do a koji build from my system. It says “AuthError: Invalid session or bad credentials”. I did run fedora-packager-setup. I am able to login to koji using the web interface. But I am not able to build using koji cli. I am trying to resolve this issue.
