2017 saw a new chapter of Pycon in India, [Pycon Pune](http://pune.pycon.org). Pycon Pune 2017 felt more community focused, had loads of upstream contributors as speakers and participants, community booths (Pyladies, PSF) and loads of hacking.

Pycon Pune 2017 was a 4 day event, from 16 Feb - 19 Feb. The first 2 days were conference days, and the remainder 2 were for devsprints. This was my first year as a Pycon volunteer. I spent most of the time with [Farhaan](https://twitter.com/fhackdroid) recording talks and running around with mic during QA sessions. Another great thing about this Pycon was that I had my wife, [Sumukhi](https://www.facebook.com/sugita.paul) attend Pycon with me. Although, it was a totally new world for her, sometimes boring and dauting, yet, she had fun time volunteering in the conference.

**What I liked about the conference**

- Single track: it was easier to focus
- Great opensource talks
- A lot of keynotes by awesome speakers across the globe
- The venue
- More open source community centered
- devsprints with upstream contributors

**What I didn't like**

- Conference badges (it was printed in haste, in the last moment)
- There was no separate rooms for coding and discussions

**Talks I liked**

- Keynote by Honza Kral
- Writing beautiful code
- Keynote by John 'warthog9' Hawley
- Building trust in releases
- Keynote and scientific lightshow by Pravin Patil
- Keynote by Katie Cunningham
- Pagure - Past, Present, Future by Farhaan and Vivek
- Django on steroids - lessons from scale by Sanket Saurav
- Keynote by Terri Oda

I pitched [Opencabs](https://github.com/rtnpro/opencabs) (An open source web framework to manage cab services), a pet project of mine, in the lightning talks and it got the attention of quite a few folks who want to solve social problem statements with Open Source.

Devsprints were fun. It was about mentoring and getting mentored. While I mentored a few folks to get their feet wet in Django by contributing to Opencabs, I got mentored by [Honza](https://twitter.com/HonzaKral) to resume my contributions to Django, and [Nick Coghlan](https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev) to submit my [first pull request](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/173) to Cpython. In the midst of all these, I didn't manage time to hack on [ircb](https://github.com/rtnpro/ircb), but I am optimistic to land a few commits to it this week.

To sum up, Pycon Pune was fun and I am looking forward to it next year.
