> Yes, I breathe in the quiet air,  
>  And raise my face toward the sky and jump in  
>  If it rains, I’ll take a break  
>  And let the wind decide where I go  
>  I carry along many regrets  
>  But letting these wounds go to waste is stupid  
>  Carve a medal into your chest and set sail  
>  Your life becomes a “showtime” from there
