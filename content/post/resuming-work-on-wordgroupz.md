Some trivial issues like :</div><div>* webkit.WebView.load_string(), the backward_forward list doesn’t work nicely. Rather, if you jump to a new link, you cannot come back to the original load_string page.</div><div>* opening and editing html with beautifulsoup disables the javascripts.</div><div></div>The post is brought to you by [lekhonee-gnome](http://fedorahosted.org/lekhonee) v0.9
