Today, I will be speaking about a typical, healthy and active day from my life. This is about a lifestyle I was able to attain and sustain, discovered during the course of my journey to become fit and stronger.

Some time ago, I was leading a very undisciplined life, working day and night, eating whatever's palatable, and I was getting fatter and fatter, reached up to 83 Kgs. Around 2 years back, I started my journey to become fit and get back into shape. I started working out at the gym, experimenting with my diet: eating less, eating more, eating right stuff. After going through hell lot of pain, I came to a point where I was able to see the results: reducing weight and waist line, feeling fit and strong, when I became self motivated to work out daily and follow proper diet and sleeping pattern. I reached a weight of 65 Kgs some months back and I have been maintaining it since then. The best part about it is the feeling of being active and fit throughout the day.

I will now share with you a brief description of a typical day from my life.
