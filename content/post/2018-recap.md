The year 2018 was quite an eventful/happening year for me.

- Job change
- Travels
- Relocation
- Upstream contributions


### Job change

In late 2017, I left Red Hat to join Zapier as an Infrastructure Engineer. It was a new role, a new challenge for me with loads of learning opportunities. 

### A year at Zapier

#### Onboarding

I started working for Zapier from October 16, 2017. The onboarding process in Zapier was really one of the best experiences I had so far, in any of my jobs. I was asked to purchase my work laptop, well in advance of my joining date, so that I can get productive from the first day. All the onboarding tasks were properly itemized, and my manager, James Carr, and my colleague, Kishore Nallan, spent considerable time with me to ramp me up with Zapier's infrastructure. This being my first job in the Infrastructure role, I took some time to get the hang of `On call`, but I eventually got the hang of it, with the help of `trial by fire` (production issues) and pairing. Also, the customer support shifts were really helpful to get me acquainted with the product. This helped me to have more context in the work I was doing and how it affected our customers.

### Major stints

#### Kafka upgrade

#### Kickstart product review pipeline on Kubeernetes

### Relocation
